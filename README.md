Hello,

I'm Alex Barnes. I am graduating from the UC Davis Masters of Business Analytics program soon and I'm currently building out more of a GitHub profile. I have some old work from when I was in undergrad on here but that code isn't very good. If you have any questions or comments about the code please contact me via my websites contact page [here](https://alexanderjbarnes.com)
